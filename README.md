# punctuation
# R script
The following script helps plot clear graphs from Google Ngram corpus. Although N-gram Viewer can output a graph that depicts the historical changes of frequency for a particular phrase (or word), the quality of graph is quite low. We therefore took use of ‘ngramr’ package (Carmody, 2015) in R programming language to extract the N-gram data and plotted new graphs based on these data. After that, all graphs were integrated into a page to yield a high-quality chart which is Figure 4 (the R script we wrote is provided to help those who would like to replicate it). 

# Python scripts
Following the order of four scripts, you can apply them to get the results as R scripts.
